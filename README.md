The evaluation consists of various mathematical operations and visualizations.
Ultimately, it pushes two graphs and an edited version of the uploaded video back to the web application.
2) index.html = this file contains the HTML code for the web application.
It defines the user interface and the design of the web application.
3) Technical report.docx = this file contains a clear and brief overview of the software product. 
It outlines the technical details and main choices of the implementation.
4) Group7_User_Workflow.mp4 = this file shows an exemplary user workflow, in case the environment will face difficulties running without explicit setup. 
We kindly thank for consideration by the professor, in such a scenario.
